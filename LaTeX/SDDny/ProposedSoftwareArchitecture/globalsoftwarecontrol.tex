\section{Global software control}

In OOSE section 7.4.4 there is mentioned three types of control flow paradigms. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Procedure-driven control: Operations will wait for an input from actor whenever data is needed. 
	\item Event-driven control: The control flow is determined by events.
	\item Threads: This is a concurrent version of procedure-driven control.
\end{itemize}

 When having multiple components in a system you can combine control flow paradigms.
 
 \emph{CalendarManagement saves data locally through FileStorage.} When saving data locally it is procedure driven. Whenever FileStorage needs data it will wait for input from CalendarManagement.
 
 \emph{CommunicationManagement is the link between CalendarManagement and SyncSubsystem \& ShareSubsystem.} The control flow of the CommunicationManagement is event-driven.
 
 \emph{SyncSubsystem \& ShareSubsystem communicate through RDBMSStorage with the server}. The control flow of the RDBMSStorage is thread-driven since the subsystem both handles sharing with other users and synchronizing the local Calendars with the server.
