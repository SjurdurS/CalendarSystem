\section{Global software control}

In OOSE section 7.4.4 there is mentioned three types of control flow paradigms. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Procedure-driven control: Operations will wait for an input from actor whenever data is needed. 
	\item Event-driven control: The control flow is determined by events.
	\item Threads: This is a concurrent version of procedure-driven control.
\end{itemize}

 When having multiple components in a system 

 Events determines the control flow of the system. The design of the control flow will be event-driven.
