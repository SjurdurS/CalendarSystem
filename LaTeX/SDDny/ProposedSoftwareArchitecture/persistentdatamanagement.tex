\subsection{Persistent data}

\textbf {FileStorage} is responsible for storing the data from the \textit{calendar} on the computer. This functionality is used before the system is synchronized. When synchronized, the data is stored in \textit{RDBMStorage}, and the data in \textit{FileStorage} is deleted. 

\textbf{RDBMStorage} is responsible for storing all data from \textit{CalendarManagement} in a database for the server. 


\subsection*{Selecting strategy}
\begin{itemize}
	\item In the \textit{FileStorage} the data is stored as flat files in plain text. 
	\item Data in \textit{RDBMStorage} is stored in af Relational Database. 
\end{itemize}
