\paragraph{Usability: } The Calendar system should be designed with the goal in mind that it should be fairly easy to use by the Client. 

\paragraph{Response time: } The Calendar system should be quite responsive to user input, and commonly make actions in a matter of milliseconds. 

\paragraph{Extensibility: } The Calendar system should support the opportunity to extend the program and make it interact with different calendar programs such as Google Calendar, Exchange and iCal.
