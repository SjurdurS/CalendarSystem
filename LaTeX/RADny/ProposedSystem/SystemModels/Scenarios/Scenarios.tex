\subsection{Scenarios}
1: 
Nicolai just got an offer for a new job and wants to delete his old work calendar and replace it with a new one. Nicolai opens his calendar system and selects his old work calendar. He then searches for events he wants to transfer to his new calendar. He finds two events in the old work calendar he wants to transfer to his new calendar. Nicolai then creates a new calendar and creates his first event. While creating his second event, he gets a message saying his job offer is rejected. Luckily Nicolai didn?t quit his old job, so he decides to synchronize his calendar to see if the old one is still on the server.

2:
Peter has a bad day. Just as he is editing his calendar the lightning strikes down in the tree in the backyard and the power goes down and the computer crashes. Peter tries to reboot the computer but the computer will not start. Peter concludes the smoke from the hardware means his computer is now broken. The following week Peter gets himself a new computer. Peter installs the calendar system again and is annoyed that all his calendars are lost. But then Peter remembers that the calendars are stored on the server and that the calendars are not lost.
Peter synchronizes his calendar system with the server and all his calendars are restored.
